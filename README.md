# Iris Clustering Project

## Overview

This project performs clustering on the Iris dataset using K-Means clustering in R. The goal is to identify groups of similar observations based on the flower's features and evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering using visualizations and silhouette analysis.

## Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is a classic dataset that contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample is classified into one of three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Technologies Used

- R
- RStudio
- Packages:
  - `ggplot2`: For data visualization
  - `cluster`: For clustering algorithms
  - `factoextra`: For enhanced visualization of clustering results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- R and RStudio installed on your machine.
- Required R packages installed. You can install them using the following commands in R:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("cluster")
install.packages("factoextra")
